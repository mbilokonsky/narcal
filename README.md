# Narrative Calculus
A set of axioms, primitives and operations for analyzing and generating narratives using calculus.

## Core Ideas
A story can be _decomposed_ into its constituent stories. (Concretely: the story of Star Wars includes, as a part of it, the story of Obi Wan Kenobi. The story of Obi Wan includes, as part of it, aspects of the story of Anakin Skywalker, etc.

Multiple stories can be _composed_ into a new single story that derives its properties from the constituent parts.

A story can be _sliced_ into thin parts according to some criteria. ("Slice by chapter / scene / page / plot point"), and slices can be _stitched_ into a new story.

The _derivative_ of a story is the set of deltas that capture the changes between its slices. A derivative can be _integrated_ against the first narrative slice of another story, or _synthesized_ against the entirety of another story.

See the axioms and operations for a full set of capabilities.

## How To Use
Paste `narcal.prompt` into your chat-gpt session or use it to seed a completion request. Then you can make use of the operations defined.
